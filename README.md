# AML-Disease-Symptom
Code developed for Applied Machine Learning @Â SDU Project: "Disease Symptom Prediction"

The main objective of this project is to research the possible application of different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Neural Networks (NN), within the medical field in order to improve the efficacy of disease diagnosis based on the presented symptom for each patient. This was performed using both a binary and multi-class classification approaches, and the stability of each model against statistical noise was also tested by randomly introducing and removing symptoms, providing a more realistic environment simulating the real-world use case.

The dataset considered for this project is the publicly available Disease Symptom Prediction dataset uploaded by Pranay Patil on Kaggle, publicly available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset/data.
